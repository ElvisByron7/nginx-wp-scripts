This is a very basic repo. It consist in 2 files:

1. `addvhost.sh`
2. `wp.sh`

They will help you to streamline a basic virtual host configuration in a Ubuntu machine using Nginx. Also, in case you would like to chose Wordpress, the `wp.sh` script will guide you to install it without messing around with databases, etc. It will do everything automatically.

In a fresh machine, they should be used in order. 

## What's next

It's not perfect. Currently the code is clunky (I'm not a dev!) and I've identified some flaws (mostly at the information level - the script should be able to show what has done at the end...), but it's 100% usable.
